# Description

I was hiking in the woods when I stumbled across this amazing thing: thousands of these orange structures! I stopped to take a photo but then this cat had to photo bomb my otherwise perfect photo with it's tail! Can you find where this photo was taken?

Move to the exact location where this photo was taken in Google Street View, and then submit the coordinates (latitude and longitude) from the url in the format lactf{LAT, LONG}

For example, if the photo celebrating the anniversary of the Bruin Bear statue was the target photo, then this would be the correct Google Street View location, and the answer to submit would be lactf{34.0710103, -118. 4449715}

# Solution

Hint given in the description, thousands of these orange structures!. Reverse image the picture that was given, search shows fushimi inari taisha. Based on the image, we can determine its a right turn direction. 
Some key details of the image would be a pole on the right as well as a structure of the right side. Based on google maps the direction would be facing the west side. Now just find the location with the details
