# Assignment Brief

Good job, intern. We were able to deploy agents to the new meetup point, and they got a hint on where the next location will be posted. One of the agents mentioned that they overheard William saying to “check other socials” for the next location meetup, and that they will be getting the intern to post the new location.

Find the platform that the intern will be posting the next meetup location, and where the meetup will be organized. We suggest using automated tools for this assignment. 

# Solution

A Pastebin entry protected by a password was discovered through OSINT. The password was obtained from the intern’s Instagram account. The recovered string was identified as an H3 geospatial index. Decoding the index yielded coordinates corresponding to Shanghai Pudong International Airport.
