# Assignment Brief

Good job, intern. We were able to deploy agents to the new meetup point, and they got a hint on where the next location will be posted. One of the agents mentioned that they overheard William saying to “check other socials” for the next location meetup, and that they will be getting the intern to post the new location.

Find the platform that the intern will be posting the next meetup location, and where the meetup will be organized. We suggest using automated tools for this assignment. 

# Solution

Instagram OSINT was conducted on accounts referencing 'YBN' and 'intern'. The account 'ryotheintern' posted an image of a bear statue. Reverse image searching the statue identified Atour Hotel in Shanghai, which matched the flag.

# Flag
