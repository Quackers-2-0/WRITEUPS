# Description

Oh, NO! Poor MEGAN! She's just been bitten by a ZOMBIE! We can save her if we act fast, but the formula for the antidote has been encoded somehow. Figure out how to unscramble the formula to save Megan from certain zombification.

Submit the flag as deadface{here-is-the-answer}.

The formula for the antidote:
