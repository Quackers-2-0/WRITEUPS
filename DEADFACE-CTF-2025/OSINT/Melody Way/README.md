# Solution

The provided image file was reverse searched using Google Lens, revealing a location in South Korea. Additional investigation led to a nearby restaurant blog post listing the address, 661 Gyeongin-ro, Guro District, Seoul, South Korea. Cross-referencing the location on Google Maps identified the building opposite the address as D-Cube City.
