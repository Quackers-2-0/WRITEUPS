# Challenge Name

Pot of Greed

# Description

We got a report from a law firm on the east coast that one of Turbo Tactical’s laptops was hacked. Based on what we heard on the call, it sounds like DEADFACE. The team is paranoid now and needs to figure out where this attack occurred. Can you use your detective skills and see if DEADFACE has mentioned anything about a specific location that they executed their attack from.

Enter the answer as deadface{Business_Name}

# Solution

A link from the GhostTown starter challenge led to the Turbo Tactical page. Scrolling through forum posts revealed an image containing a street sign referencing Capitol Hill, Washington DC. Using Google Maps, nearby coffee houses were enumerated until Ebenezer’s Coffeehouse was identified.
