# Description

I really like Go Go Squid! In fact, I like it so much that I even bought the same model of cabinet
that is in the series!

Can you find:

  1. The first and last name of the designer of this cabinet?

  2. The episode and timestamp that this cabinet first appears at all in the series on YouTube?

Flag format: uoftctf{First_Last_EpisodeNum_MM:SS}

Example: uoftctf{John_Doe_06_07:27}
  
Notes:
  
  1. Mind the flag format/example :)
  
  2. There is a 1-second fowards leniency in the timestamp (if 1:00 is correct, then 1:01 is correct)

# Solution

They provide a picture of the cabinet. Had to differentiate the cabinet to other ikea cabinet. 
Found the exact model https://www.ikea.com/sg/en/p/fabrikoer-glass-door-cabinet-black-blue-80363172/ and determined who created the cabonet, it was Nike Karlsson. 
From there I had to go through each episode of Go Go Squid to find at which timestamp was the cabinet appeared first. And found the episode, it was episode 3 at 4mins and 40secs.
